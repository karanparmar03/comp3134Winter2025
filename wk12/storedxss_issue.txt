Stored XSS was tested using a simple PHP comment form where user input was written to a file and displayed back on the page without any sanitization.

Malicious input like:
<script>alert('Stored XSS!')</script>

was submitted via the form, and every time the page reloaded, the script executed automatically.

This confirmed a stored XSS vulnerability.

Mitigation:
To fix this, all user-submitted content should be sanitized using functions like htmlspecialchars() before displaying it on the page to prevent script execution.
