First Solution (No Mitigation):

Description: The first solution (i.e., sending_info_to_app_1.php) directly outputs user input without any sanitization or validation. This approach could be risky as it allows any input, including potentially malicious code (such as <script> tags), to be executed by the browser.

Issue:

Security Risk: Without any mitigation, an attacker could inject harmful scripts, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. For example, if a user enters a script like <script>alert('hello')</script>, it will execute JavaScript in the user's browser, causing potential harm such as stealing cookies, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.



Second Solution (Sanitization and Mitigation):
Description: The second solution (i.e., sending_info_to_app_2.php) uses strip_tags() and htmlspecialchars() functions to sanitize the user input.

strip_tags() removes any HTML tags from the input (including <script> tags).

htmlspecialchars() converts special characters like <, >, and & into their HTML entity equivalents, preventing them from being interpreted as HTML code.

Benefit:

Security: This solution prevents XSS attacks by making sure any harmful code input by users is displayed as text, not executed. The malicious script input is sanitized and shown as plain text without being run.
