To mitigate the directory traversal vulnerability:
- I used the `basename()` function to ensure users cannot traverse directories.
- I implemented `realpath()` and `file_exists()` to ensure that the path is valid and within the allowed directory.
- I added a check to block filenames with a dot (.) to prevent access to sensitive files.
