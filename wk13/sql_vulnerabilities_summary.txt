SQL Injection Vulnerabilities Summary

1) Using the page getusers_1.php, type the following value into the form: Ben
Observations: 
The query returns results for users with the first name "Ben" and active = 1. This is the expected behavior as no SQL injection was attempted.

2) Using the page getusers_1.php, type the following value into the form: Ben'--
Observations: 
The SQL query is broken due to the SQL injection. The '--' causes the rest of the query to be commented out, which results in all users being returned instead of just those matching "Ben".

3) Using the page getusers_1.php, type the following value into the form: Ben' OR 1=1
Observations: 
The query returns all users because `1=1` is always true, which bypasses the condition and makes the SQL query return all data from the table.
